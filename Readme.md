JSON to Excel Converter
Description
This Python script allows the user to convert a JSON file into an Excel file (.xlsx format). The user will be prompted to select a JSON file from their system, and an Excel file will be generated in the same directory as the Python script.

Requirements
Python 3.x
openpyxl library for Excel operations
tkinter for the file dialog
You can install openpyxl using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install openpyxl
Usage
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python convertor.py
A file dialog will appear, asking you to select the JSON file you wish to convert.

After selecting the file, the script will automatically generate an Excel file in the same directory as the Python script. The Excel file will have the same name as the JSON file but with _convert_to_json.xlsx appended.

How It Works
The script reads a JSON file chosen by the user.
It iterates over the key-value pairs in the JSON object.
It then writes these key-value pairs into an Excel sheet.
The Excel sheet is saved in the same directory as the Python script.
Troubleshooting
Make sure you have all the required libraries installed.
Ensure the JSON file you select is a valid JSON file.
Future Enhancements
Support for nested JSON objects
Option to specify output directory
